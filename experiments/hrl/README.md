* `find_model.run()`: Verify the ability of your chosen model to represent the data
* `gridsearch.run()`: Find the hyperparameters that perform the best. No performance measure was implemented, so you have to look at the plots and visually gauge relative performance.
* `long_trial.run()`: Train an agent without a limit on the number of steps to see how long it takes to learn the task.
